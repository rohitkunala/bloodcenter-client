Platelets, an element of blood which has been a major commodity for the patient lives as per their availability. As the blood platelets have lower span of life they need to be reached to the hospital as per the demand .The blood is collected in blood facilities and the respective tests are conducted in the blood center and blood should be supplied to the hospitals. For this an optimized healthcare supply chain is to be designed starting from the blood facilities to the hospital in the end. The locations of the blood facilities are positioned in a effective way so that the total cost and energy consumption will be efficient. The existing methodologies are too complicated for a numerical experiment. Hence mathematical tools are used for this problem. A numerical experiment is held considering the locations of donors, blood center and hospital and an optimized location for the blood facilities is found. The results shows the minimized cost and maximum energy efficiency.
