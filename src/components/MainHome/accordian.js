          <Typography>Is blood donation safe ?</Typography>
        </AccordionSummary>
        <AccordionDetails>
          <Typography>
            Blood donation is safe. New, sterile disposable equipment is used
            for each donor, so there's no risk of contracting a bloodborne
            infection by donating blood. If you're a healthy adult, you can
            usually donate a pint (about half a liter) of blood without
            endangering your health.
